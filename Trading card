			<p>Known to give birth around the same time, female lions (lionesses) will take care of cubs until the age of two or three. Cubs are generally raised among multiple liters and get to be raised by multiple different moms. Shortly after raising her cubs until the age of 2 or 3, a mother lion will return the estrus cycle and is ready to give birth to another litter. With the coming of new cubs, the older male and female cubs are pushed out of the pack and forced to fend for themselves</p>
